# RNN
A standard many to one neural network, made for the purpose of binary classification (sorting given sentences as being either positive or negative leaning)

Standard machine learning principles like gradient descent, derivation through chain rule, Xavier initialization, softmax, and cross entropy loss are demonstrated in this code. 

Currently updating to account for neutral cases and greater variation in vocabulary 

Run using $ python main.py through the terminal
